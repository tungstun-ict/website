## Book ordering
<div class="collapsible">

Bijleveld wanted to give customers the opportunity to reserve books online but did not want the overhead of managing a complete online store. Together we came to the conclusion that a complex ordering form would be the best solution. You can input the title of the book and your contact info, within a day the bookstore personally replies with the next steps. This way even obscure books can be queried by the customer. This is a human centered approach that suits the bookstore very well.
